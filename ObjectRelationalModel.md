# Object Relational DBMSs

- Object orientation is an approach to software construction that has shown considerable promise for solving some of the classic problems of software development.  
- The underlying concept behind object technology is that all software should be constructed out of standard, reusable components wherever possible.   
- Traditionally,software engineering and database management have existed as separate disciplines.   
- Database technology has concentrated on the static aspects of information storage, while software engineering has modeled the dynamic aspects of software.  

- With the arrival of the third generation of database management systems, namely Object-Relational Database Management Systems (ORDBMSs) and Object-Oriented Database Management Systems (OODBMSs), the two disciplines have been combined to allow the concurrent modeling of both data and the processes acting upon the data.
